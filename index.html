          <h1>Hello, I am <span>Kavita</span> </h1>
          <p> I’m a stay-at-home Mom who does freelance graphic design work for friends and family on ad-hoc basis. Every day is unique filled with many challenges. I’m very good at multi-tasking and used to last minute changes in my schedule, so I am fluid when changes occur. I feel very satisfied at the end of the day when I can accommodate these changes and still accomplish everything. I plan for the day and adapt to changes when needed. </p>
          <p>I have worked as interior designer during start of my career in India. I have worked as a commercial interior designer for multinational companies like Accenture and local hospitals, builders etc. It has been a really fulfilling and rewarding career as interior designer where I enjoyed working with clients to understand requirements to create design that improves wellbeing, safety and function of the interior performance of a space. </p>
          <p>After moving to Ireland in 2007, I was not able to find any good opportunities in construction industry due to recession. I was introduced to graphic design and started learning various aspects of design. Having a creative mind, I really enjoyed learning different tools like Photoshop, Illustrator etc. It was challenging at the start but with online help available, I started enjoying how different adobe tools can be used for graphic designing. I have learnt how to design logos, brochures, posters, flyers, print ads and much more. I believe it is important to develop professional skills and learning new things all the time. I am very passionate about my work and have a flair for creativity and design. I like painting and drawing sketches. </p>

          <p> After I moved to UK in 2014, I got opportunity to work as a volunteer for Stoke-on-Trent Council, locality fundraising group. I had opportunity to learn new skills like setting up Facebook page for “Inspiring Communities Together” that represents local communities across Stoke on Trent. I have also involved managing content for Facebook page. I have created flyers for various events like Family voice, People Power, Robot Design for kids, Mix & Mingle. Also created mood board for Christmas Event. The volunteer experience provided me opportunity to use myself taught graphic design skills. </p>
          <p>In recent years, I have developed interest in creating website. I have tried using WordPress to create sample site. The process of developing website got me interested into UI / UX design. I started reading about it and got more interested in website design. I have started learning web design using the tutorial provided by Code Your Future since 2021. Looking at the current technology with my interest growing in website design, I strongly feel the need to learn these skills. I think Code Your Future, has provides me the guiding steps in the fascinating world of website design.</p>
          <p>I like yoga, dance and currently involved in doing charity work for ISKON to help people within the community. I also love to cook find new recipes and tweak them to persuade my family to eat healthy. </p>
          <p>I am trying to return back to work after a career break. I am eager to gain valuable skills and grow more as professional to find jobs within the IT industry.</p>
